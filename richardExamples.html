					<h1>Programming Assignments</h1>

						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="downloads\richardRPGGameRunnable.jar" download>Object Oriented RPG Game (.jar file)</a></dt>
							<dd>This Java project uses object orientated concepts such as 
							abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation to make 
							a battle game. The user chooses one of three unique heroes 
							to battle against a monster where a winner is determined. The user 
							can upgrade stats, buy items, and advance to defeat increasingly 
							difficult monsters.

							<dt><a href="downloads\richardAnimalRecorderRunnable.jar" download>Animal Recorder (.jar file)</a></dt>
							<dd>For this Java assignment, we made a program that would allow
							researches to record details about antarctic animals. This includes
							its body weight, sex, coordinates, and more for one of 
							three animal species. It stores the details for each entry into an
							external txt file using file input and output methods.
							The project also demonstrates object oriented design.
							Each animal has its own class with its own properties. Each animal 
							is a child of an animal class that hosts shared properties 
							between each.

							folder above, extract all the files to a new location, and 
							load the Blackjack.exe application from the new
							location. The python file is also included so you
