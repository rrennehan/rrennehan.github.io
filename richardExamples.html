							<dd>This Java project uses object orientated concepts such as 
							abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation to make 
							a battle game. The user chooses one of three unique heroes

							can upgrade stats, buy items, and advance to defeat increasingly 
							difficult monsters. <br />

							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardAnimalRecorderRunnable.jar" download>Animal Recorder (.jar file)</a></dt>
							<dd>For this Java assignment, we made a program that would allow
							researches to record details about antarctic animals. This includes
							its body weight, sex, coordinates, and more for one of 
							three animal species. It stores the details for each entry into an
							external txt file using file input and output methods.
							The project also demonstrates object oriented design.
							Each animal has its own class with its own properties. Each animal 
							is a child of an animal class that hosts shared properties 
							between each. <br />
