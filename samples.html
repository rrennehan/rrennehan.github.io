					<h1>Programming Assignments</h1>
					<dl>
						<h2>Note: An up-to-date version of Java is required to run the jar files.</h2>
						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardRPGGameRunnable.jar" download>Object Oriented RPG Game (.jar file)</a></dt>
							<dd>This Java project tasked me with using object orientated concepts such as 
							abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation to make 
							a battle game. The user chooses one of three unique heroes 
							to battle against a monster where a winner is determined. The user 
							can upgrade stats, buy items, and advance to defeat increasingly 
							difficult monsters up to level 3.<br />

							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardAnimalRecorderRunnable.jar" download>Animal Recorder (.jar file)</a></dt>
							<dd>An application that would allow researchers to 
							record details for penguins, sea lions, and 
							walruses, such as their sex, weight, and GPS coordinates.
							The program stores the details in an external txt file
							using file input and output methods.
							<br />

						</div>
						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardScreensaverRunnable.jar" download>Bouncing Shapes Screensaver (.jar file)</a></dt>
							<dd>A screensaver-like application in Java. By clicking inside,
							a shape is generated. Shapes bounce off the walls and
							off each other. Makes successful use of late-binding, 
							java.awt graphics, and a timer to update the screensaver 60
							times per second.<br />
							<a href="downloads\prog\richardScreensaverContents.zip" download>(Alternatively click here to see the java files)</a>

						</div>
						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\countriesApplication.zip" download>Countries of the World (.zip folder)</a></dt>
							<dd>A graphical application made using PyQT5 designer. The 
							user is presented with a list of all countries. When
							the user clicks on a country, its flag is displayed 
							along with more information. To run it, download the zip 
							folder, extract it to a new location, and run the "Countries of the World.exe" 
							file from the new location. The python code is also provided.

						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardBlackJackGame.zip" download>BlackJack Game (.zip folder)</a></dt>
							<dd><p>A personal project I did using Python. I wanted to put all the 
							introductory programming skills I learned in my 
							introduction to programming course to the test.</p>
							
							<p>This project is a functional blackjack game that works
							in command line. The user starts with 1000 chips and can bet
							any amount under their balance each round. Each round, the 
							user draws random cards from the deck and tries to stay under
							a total of 21. If they go over 21, they lose the bet. The user
							can choose to stop at any time. Upon stopping, the dealer gets
							its turn, also drawing cards randomly. The program checks to see
							whether the dealer or the player won, and takes or gives chips as
							needed.</p>
							
							To play it, simply download the zip 
							folder above, extract all the files to a new location, and 
							load the Blackjack.exe application from the new
							location. The python file is also included so you
							can view the code. Comes with a 
							functioning leaderboard.

							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardCalculator.apk" download>Android Calculator (.apk folder)</a></dt>
							<dd>My very first Android application. Works as a rolling-calculator with 
								no order of operations (BEDMAS) applied. I've worked hard to ensure the 
								app feels clean and responsive, and does not crash.

							<dt><a href="poker.html" target="_blank">Poker API Site</a></dt>
							<dd>Learning how to use fetch with JavaScript. This site uses a 
								card dealing API to give two 5 card hands. I coded 
								a scoring system in JavaScript to determine the rank/score of 
								each hand and determine the winner. You can also view stats to 
								see how often each hand rank showed up.
