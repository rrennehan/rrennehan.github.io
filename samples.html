							<dt><a href="Qwicky's Run/main.html" target="_blank">Qwicky's Run</a></dt>
							<dd>Meet Qwicky. Qwicky has the ability to swap colors and flip gravity. In this game, 
								Qwicky must swap colors to match the color of the on-coming lasers. Miss 3 times
								and Qwicky hits a game over. <br />
								(This JavaScript game is only compatible with keyboards)
							<br />
							<img src="images/qwickysRun.PNG" alt="">
							<div class="experience"> 
								This assignment is currently a work in progress. Upcoming features include an 
								online leaderboard and controls for mobile devices. This is what I chose to do for my final Client Side Programming 
								class assignment and has since become a passion project.
							</div></br>

						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="poker.html" target="_blank">Poker API Site</a></dt>
							<dd>This site uses a card dealing API to give two 5 card hands. I coded 
								a scoring system in JavaScript to determine the rank/score of 
								each hand and determine the winner. You can also view stats to 
								see how often each hand rank showed up. </br>
							<video controls src="videos/poker.mp4" Your browser does not support the video tag.></video>
							<div class="experience"> 
								This assignment reminded me that it's important to break the workload down to 
								pieces. My original draft of this would only score the highest card in each hand. 
								I continued to add scoring features piece by piece.

						</div>
						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="downloads/prog/richardMovieTrailerApp.apk" download>Android Movie Trailer App (.apk)</a></dt>
							<dd>My final assignment for Mobile Android Application Development. The user can view movie trailers along with their 
								description. The user can add movie trailers and delete existing ones at will. Movie details are saved using a 
								connection to an SQLite database. <br />
							<video controls src="videos/movieTrailerApp.mp4" Your browser does not support the video tag.></video>
							<div class="experience">
								This is an extension of everything I have learned in Android Development thus far. I spent countless hours 
								ensuring the database components work without crashing the app or running into logic errors. I also focused 
								on designing a modern, light layout and look. I consider this assignment to be a crowning achievement. I plan 
								to use this as a prime demonstration of my skills to future employers.

							<dt><a href="downloads/prog/richardPictureSelect.apk" download>Android Picture Select App (.apk)</a></dt>
							<dd>The purpose of this assignment was to tackle responsive design for all devices. On 
								narrow devices, only one pane is shown at a time. On wider devices, two panes are shown at once, 
								displaying both the list and image at the same time. This assignment also implements other features 
								including shared preference saving and xml animations. <br />
							<video controls src="videos/pictureSelectApp.mp4" Your browser does not support the video tag.></video>
							<div class="experience">
								This assignment used the master detail template as a base. As a result, this tested my ability to read, 
								understand, and work with pre-existing code. I figured out the structure and flow over time. Eventually, I 
								was able to add features like selection shading and image animations that play when an item on the list is clicked.

							rolling-calculator with no order of operations applied (as requested by professor). <br />
							<video controls src="videos/calculator.mp4" Your browser does not support the video tag.></video>
							<div class="experience">
								This is my first full Android application. Fortunately, I had lots of practice 
								with setting up interfaces before this assignment. My vision was to replicate how 
								the official calculator works on apple devices, but using a fresh coat of paint. 
								This took more logic than expected. I would improve this by adding more functions to 
								eliminate duplicated code.

							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardRPGGameRunnable.jar" download>Object Oriented RPG Game (.jar file)</a></dt>
							<dd>This Java project tasked me with using object orientated concepts such as 
							abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation to make 
							a battle game. The user chooses one of three unique heroes 
							to battle against a monster where a winner is determined. The user 
							can upgrade stats, buy items, and advance to defeat increasingly 
							difficult monsters up to level 3.<br />

							<video controls src="videos/rpgGame.mp4" Your browser does not support the video tag.></video>
							<div class="experience">
								This was my first object-oriented project, so learning how to work with 
								classes took time. I was having trouble imagining how the program would work. Once I learned 
								it can be as simple as setting up a main class and making calls to other classes, it clicked for me.

							The program stores the details in an external txt file
							using file input and output methods.
							<br />
							<a href="downloads\prog\richardAnimalRecorderContents.zip" download>(Alternatively click here to see the java files)</a></br>
							<div class="experience">
								For this project, I used Scanner and FileWriter. At one point, I had no idea why 
								changes were not being saved, until I learned I needed to close the Scanner and 
								FileWriter. Now that I'm studying Android development, I have switched to BufferedReader, 
								FileInputStream, and FileOutputStream.

						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardScreensaverRunnable.jar" download>Bouncing Shapes Screensaver (.jar file)</a></dt>
							<dd>A screensaver-like application in Java. By clicking inside,
							a shape is generated. Shapes bounce off the walls and
							off each other. Makes successful use of late-binding, 
							java.awt graphics, and a timer to update the screensaver 60
							times per second.<br />

							<div class="experience">
								After my RPG game, I was curious how I could make 
								an application with moving objects. Funny enough, I was granted the opportunity 
								when this was assigned as my final project. I discovered you can use a timer 
								combined with java graphics libraries to move objects bit by bit. I particularly 
								liked using the debugger to check for object collision frame by frame.

						</div>
						<div class="dlGroup">
							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\countriesApplication.zip" download>Countries of the World (.zip folder)</a></dt>
							<dd>A graphical application made using PyQT5 designer. The 
							user is presented with a list of all countries. When
							the user clicks on a country, its flag is displayed 
							along with more information. To run it, download the zip 
							folder, extract it to a new location, and run the "Countries of the World.exe" 
							file from the new location. The python code is also provided. </br>
							<video controls src="videos/countries.mp4" Your browser does not support the video tag.></video>
							<div class="experience">
								A particular challenge was getting the correct flag to show up. This was solved 
								by making the filenames for the flags the same as the country names in the list. Then, I 
								could grab the name of the list item, concatenate an image extension, and then search the 
								directory for the corresponding flag image.

							<dt><a href="downloads\prog\richardBlackJackGame.zip" download>BlackJack Game (.zip folder)</a></dt>
							<dd><p>A personal project I did using Python. I wanted to put all the 
							introductory programming skills I learned in my 
							introduction to programming course to the test.</p>
							
							<p>This project is a functional blackjack game that works
							in command line. The user starts with 1000 chips and can bet
							any amount under their balance each round. Each round, the 
							user draws random cards from the deck and tries to stay under
							a total of 21. If they go over 21, they lose the bet. The user
							can choose to stop at any time. Upon stopping, the dealer gets
							its turn, also drawing cards randomly. The program checks to see
							whether the dealer or the player won, and takes or gives chips as
							needed.</p>
							
							To play it, simply download the zip 
							folder above, extract all the files to a new location, and 
							load the Blackjack.exe application from the new
							location. The python file is also included so you
							can view the code. Comes with a 
							functioning leaderboard. </br>
							<video controls src="videos/blackjack.mp4" Your browser does not support the video tag.></video>
							<div class="experience">
								I learned a lot about program logic. My favorite accomplishment 
								was coding the leaderboard. Ensuring the leaderboard sorts scores 
								correctly while maintaining proper formatting took research as well as a 
								little trial and error.
